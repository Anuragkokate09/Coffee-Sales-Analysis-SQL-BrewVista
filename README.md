# ☕ **BrewVista Coffee: Brewing Growth with Data**
### *Advanced SQL Analysis for Retail & Market Expansion*

---

## 📝 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales transactions across various Indian urban markets. By leveraging **SQL**, I transformed raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence to help **BrewVista Coffee** identify its most profitable products, loyal customer segments, and high-potential cities for future expansion.

## 🛠️ **BUSINESS LOGIC & HIGHLIGHTS**
The analysis solves five critical business problems using structured query logic:

* 🚀 **Market Expansion:** Identified high-population cities with low current sales penetration to pinpoint "Gold Mine" locations for new outlets.
* 👥 **Customer Loyalty:** Tracked spending patterns to identify top-tier customers (e.g., **Aditi Gupta**, **Mira Nair**) for targeted VIP rewards.
* ⭐ **Customer Satisfaction:** Analyzed city-wise average ratings, discovering that **Chennai (4.51)** and **Bangalore (4.48)** lead in customer experience.
* 📦 **Product Performance:** Ranked products by revenue and order frequency to optimize inventory and menu design.

The project utilizes a relational database consisting of four primary tables:
1.  **`City`**: Population demographics and rental costs.
2.  **`Customers`**: Unique user profiles and location mapping.
3.  **`Products`**: Pricing and product categorization.
4.  **`Sales`**: Transactional records including dates, totals, and customer ratings.
