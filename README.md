Data-Driven Insights for Retail Growth & Market Expansion

📝 <ins>PROJECT OVERVIEW</ins>
This project, "Brewing Growth with Data," utilizes advanced SQL to analyze coffee sales transactions across various Indian cities. The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence to optimize product offerings and identify the next big market opportunity.

The analysis is built on a relational database structure designed to handle complex retail queries:

Market Expansion Logic – Identifying high-population cities with low current sales penetration.

Customer Segmentation – Categorizing users by spending power to identify loyal "Top Spenders."

Product Optimization – Ranking menu items by order frequency to identify "Hero Products."

Sentiment Analysis – Comparing average customer ratings across different urban demographics.
